>
#### Exercise C# Sharp: 2.26 Product

>
#### Exercise C# Sharp: 2.27 Absolute value
>
> Write a program to calculate (and display) the absolute value of a number x: if the number is positive, its absolute value is exactly the number x; if it is negative, its absolute value is -x.

> Number? 5
> Total=5 Amount=1 Average=5 Maximum=5 Minimum=5
> Number? 2
> Total=7 Amount=2 Average=3 Maximum=5 Minimum=2
> Number? 0
> Bye!

> (As seen in this example, the program will finish when the user enters 0)
>
#### Exercise C# Sharp: 2.30 Switch
>
> Create a C# program to display the "text mark" corresponding to a certain "numerical mark", using the following equivalence:
>
> 9,10 = Sobresaliente
> 7,8 = Notable
> 6 = Bien
> 5 = Aprobado
> 0-4 = Suspenso
>
> Your program must ask the user for a numerical mark and display the corresponding text mark.
> You must do it twice: first using "if" and then using "switch".
>
#### Exercise C# Sharp: 2.31 Conditional operator, positive and smaller
>
> Create a C# program which asks the user for two numbers and answers, using the conditional operator (?), the following:
>
> - If the first number is positive
> - If the second number is positive
> - If they are both positive
> - Which one is smaller
>
#### Exercise C# Sharp: 2.32 Prime number
> 
> Write a program which asks the user for an integer number and answers if it is a prime number or not.
>
#### Exercise C# Sharp: 2.33 Conditional operator

>
#### Exercise C# Sharp: 2.34 Give change
>
> Create a C# program to return the change of a purchase, using coins (or bills) as large as possible. Assume we have an unlimited amount of coins (or bills) of 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1, and there are no decimal places. Thus, the execution could be something like this:
>
> Price? 44
> Paid? 100
> Your change is 56: 50 5 1
> Price? 1
> Paid? 100
> Your change is 99: 50 20 20 5 2 2
>
#### Exercise C# Sharp: 2.35 Exceptions
