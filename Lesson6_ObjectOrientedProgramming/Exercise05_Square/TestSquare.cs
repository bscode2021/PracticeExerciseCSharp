    /// and the length of its side. 
    /// 
    /// You will have to create:
    /// - A suitable constructor, to assign starting values to X, Y and the side. (2 points)
    /// - A Move method, to change X and Y coordinates. (1 point) 
    /// - A Scale method, to change its side(for example, a scale factor of 2 would turn a side of 3 into 6). (1 point)
    /// - A method ToString, to return a string with its data(for example: "Corner (10,5), side 7". (1 point)
    /// - Redefine "GetPerimeter" and "GetArea", so that they return the correct values(2 points).
    /// 
    /// - Another point corresponds to the attributes and the overall structure.
    /// 
    /// - The remaining 2 points correspond to the test from "Main"
